The classic Rubik’s cube has six faces, with each face being made up by a 3 × 3 grid of colored facets. These facets are the faces of smaller cubes, the so-called cubies. The cube consists of 26 such cubies: 8 corner cubies with three facets each, 12 edge cubies with two facets each, and 6 center cubies with one facet each. The cube is considered solved when each of its faces shows only one color.",
